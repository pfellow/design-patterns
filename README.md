This repository contains three projects:

- **TodoMasters**: Todo application used to implement classic design patterns like the Observer, Mixin, Singleton, Memento, and Command patterns.
- **CoffeeMasters**: Mobile eCommerce application to demonstrate Single Page design patterns like lazy loading, View Transitions, HTML template interpolation, and routing metadata.
- **CookingMasters**: Recipe application demonstrating Multi-Page design patterns like Page View Transitions, prefetching, and prerendering.

Each project contains an `initial` directory to be used a starting point, and `final` directory with the solution.

### Course Website

Setup instructions and coding solutions can be found in the [course website](https://firtman.github.io/webapp-patterns).

### Local Development Server

As mentioned on the [course website](https://firtman.github.io/webapp-patterns/lessons/intro-to-the-course/what-we-will-be-building), it's recommended to run each application using a local web server. You can use a VSCode extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or run `npx serve` within the `initial` or `final` project folder.
